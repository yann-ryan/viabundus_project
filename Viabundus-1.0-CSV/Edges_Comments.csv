"12","According to Le Coq's map of Westfalia (1796-1813), the road between Heede and Rhede was only usable in dry weather conditions."
"14","According to a 1690 report, the road between Salzwedel and Lübbow was only a footpath, and it was decided that the road was to be developed and a bridge had to be built to make it suitable for heavier traffic. However, it is unclear whether this observation reflects the situation in the preceding centuries, or if the road was once much used, but had deteriorated in the meantime: there is evidence for both possibilities. In any case, the waterway between Salzwedel and Lüchow provided a viable alternative to the land route."
"16","Presumably, the road between Siek and Sandesneben via Schönberg became only usual for transit traffic in the 17th century; in the Middle Ages, most of the traffic must have taken the route via the toll station Trittau."
"18","On the Kurhannoversche Landesaufnahme (1764-1784), the road between Escheburg and Schnakenbek via Geesthacht is indicated as the post road in winter between Hamburg and Lauenburg. In summer, the post took a more northerly road via Fahrendorf and Krukow, circumventing Geesthacht."
"20","The road between Iprump and Dingstede via Ganderkesee, circumventing Delmenhorst, was the main road before 1311, and was also used in later times in case of inundations of the road through Delmenhorst."
"22","According to Aulepp (1975) a road used during the High Middle Ages to reach Mühlhausen. According to Born (2017), this is the Zellscher Marktstieg. A wooden bridge led across the Mühlhausen ditch ('Mühlhäuser Landgraben') and it was originally meant for traffic on foot. In 1616 illegal broadening of the path was detected, which led to a destruction of the wooden bridges across the Mühlhausen ditch in 1621 (Born 2017, 22)."
"24","The road gained more significance in the Late Middle Ages."
"26","This road has its greatest significance in the High and Late Middle Ages. In 1609 it is mentioned as the proper road of safe conduct to Dingelstädt."
"28","Road of safe conduct from 1575."
"30","This part of the road is reconstructed with Eberhardt (1982), who says that the western route to Tennstedt bacame marshy up until most recent times, or was impassable because of a body of water. In the 15th century, this road from Eisenach to Weißensee was blocked in order to force traffic to Erfurt."
"32","In the 15th century, this road from Eisenach to Weißensee was blocked in order to force traffic to Erfurt."
"34","According to Bruns-Weczerka (1967) this road was only used as a main road since the 16th century. Since 1450 a dam existed between Edersleben and Oberröblingen, which facilitated crossing the Helme and made this route more attractive."
"36","""Roter Steiger""; according to Nagel (2001) ascent into the Harz from Quedlinburg."
"38","Historical connection between Quedlinburg and Hoym via deserted village Groß Orden according to Nagel (2001)."
"40","Flood-free detour from Halle to Merseburg."
"42","The toll station in Altengottern shows that the old Weinberg between Mühlhausen and Langensalza was circumvented to the north until the 15th century."
"44","According to Bahn (2002) this is the earlier (early medieval) course of the via regia from Erfurt to Naumburg."
"46","This part of the road originates in the 19th century and is part of the 'modern' via regia."
"48","Main course of the via regia probably since the 13th century."
"50","This road is already mentioned in 1414 as the ""Jew's road""."
"52","Segment called ""Weinstraße"" or ""Fuldaer road"" of the Via regia."
"54","Segment of the ""Kinzigstraße"", a segment of the via regia between Frankfurt/M. and Eisenach."
"56","The road between Haselünne and Wietmarschen via Teglingen, Geeste and Dalum is first attested in the 18th century. Its importance for earlier centuries is debatable; most of the traffic must have taken the route via the river crossing in Lingen."
"58","This road was a flood-free connection between Rudolstadt and Saalfeld."
"60","According to Bruns-Weczerka (1967) this road is the earlier road between Merseburg and Naumburg, which was later superseded by the road via Markröhlitz."
"62","This road was forbidden by the Ernestinians since the 1470s, however one can assume it was continued to be used."
"64","This leg of the road had to circumvent the Weißensee Obersee until 1704, when the lake was drained (Stadt Weißensee 1988, 255f.). In the 15th century, this road from Eisenach to Weißensee was blocked in order to force traffic to Erfurt (Eberhardt 1982)."
"66","Since 1515 contractually agreed upon compulsory road from Hamburg, Lübeck and Eisleben from the Harz to Thüringen. In a report to Guthmannshausen, the road via Nebra, Tauhardt and Guthmannshausen was referred to as the main road for wares originating from Lübeck, Braunschweig and Magdeburg and going to Franken. Course of the medieval 'copper road' (""Kupferstraße"")."
"68","Circumvention route of the safe conduct in Erfurt and Gotha, as proclaimed in a report to the safe conduct in Guthmannshausen from 1515. In the ""Acta die Landstraße von Weißensee nach Erfurt und die Sachsenburgische Straße betr. von 1522 - 72"" (M. st. A. Hep. A 24 b Tit. XXIV, Nr 11.) from 1522 the road is already declared deserted, due to the forced passage ('Straßenzwang') via Erfurt."
"70","Since 1515 contractually agreed upon compulsory road from Hamburg, Lübeck and Eisleben from the Harz to Thüringen. In the ""Acta die Landstraße von Weißensee nach Erfurt und die Sachsenburgische Straße betr. von 1522 - 72"" (M. st. A. Hep. A 24 b Tit. XXIV, Nr 11.) the main road from Sachsenburg to Sangerhausen is described as going via Ringleben. Shortly before the 30-year-war the Saxonian part of the road was blocked, which was supposed to force traffic to Southern Germany via Leipzig. The blockade was barely heeded due to the war, however."
"72","The direct route between Gotha and Herbsleben was the established route in 1515 that had to be taken if one did not cross the Thüringer forest on their way to Hessia. In the ""Acta die Landstraße von Weißensee nach Erfurt und die Sachsenburgische Straße betr. von 1522 - 72"" (M. st. A. Hep. A 24 b Tit. XXIV, Nr 11.) from 1522 the road is already declared deserted, due to the forced passage ('Straßenzwang') via Erfurt."
"74","According to a contract from 1515, whoever came from the north, passed the Harz and wanted to go to Crawinkel or Tambach, had to go via Erfurt with its staple."
"76","This route was used to save on the fees of safe conduct in Sangerhausen and Sachsenburg, as well as to circumvent Erfurt. The safe conduct in Eisleben was cheaper and the route continued on to Tauhardt and into the zone of safe conduct of Weimar, to continue on to the Thüringer Wald. Course of the medieval copper road ('Kupferstraße') (Gräfenthalstraße/Saalfeldsche Straße/Querstraße/Kreuzweg)."
"78","In the 16th century, the circumvention of the safe conduct in Sachsenburg and Weißensee via Kutzleben and Gebesee on the way to Erfurt was only allowed to wagoners from Nordhausen."
"80","Since the Havel was used as a mill race, water traffic was routed through the Jakob's ditch ('Jakobsgraben'). Since 1550 it has been complemented by the construction of a chamber lock in the town canal. "
"82","In 1548-50 a chamber lock was constructed in the town canal of Brandeburg, which complemented the water traffic in the Jakob's ditch ('Jakobsgraben'). The expansion of the canal and the lock had already begun in 1455, probably in connection with the staple in Brandenburg."
"84","""Beyond the Berliner mill dam there existed no water traffic to mention"" (Schich 1994, 54)."
"86","Southern circumvention of Erfurt's safe conduct according to a complaint from Erfurt."
"88","""Brücknerscher-"" or ""Ur-Rennsteig"". Already mentioned on a map of 1589 as ""Renstick"", which makes it the oldest mention of the Rennsteig on a map."
"90","Modern Rennsteig, determined in 1830 by officer Julius Plänckner from Gotha. Some segments can be traced until the 14th and 15th century. A report from 1597 shows that from then on at the latest the Rennsteig was seen as one connecting high road."
"92","Segment of the Rennsteig which is already mentioned and called as such in 1330 in the description of the Frankensteiner Wildbann."
"94","Segment of the Rennsteig that is already mentioned in records from 1039, 1143/44, 1227 and 1270, but only refered to as 'platea', a road. Also mentioned in 1330 in the description of the Frankensteiner Wildbann."
"96","""Stromelbe"", only navigable leg of the Elbe at Magdeburg. It was blocked by pileworks ('Pfahlwerke') in the 30-year-war and silted up. Only with the construction of the ""Roste""-dike until 1686 the Elbe was forced back into its Western leg."
"98","The marshy area of the ""langen wish"" was first made crossable with a causeway around 1400. In the 14th century, wagons must have taken a detour via Bodenstedt."
"100","The chamber lock in Calbe was first built in 1564."
"102","The chamber lock in Bernburg was first built in 1560."
"104","The chamber lock in Rothenburg was renewed in 1694, which indicates that it existed before."
"106","The Saale was navigable only from Naumburg, at least since 1700 there were too many mill runs and -dams ('Mühlenwehr') to the south of Naumburg that blocked the river."
"108","In 1150 a ""strata publica"" is mentioned, which is probably connected to the Klusdamm. The Klusdamm itself is first mentioned in 1479. It was well maintained in the following years, since it was a constantly dry passage through the Elbe lowland."
"110","Beyond Naumburg, the Saale river was mainly used for rafting lumber due to the many mill runs. In the Bronze Age it was surely navigated by boat."
"112","First evidence of navigation on the Unstrut in 1612, when mayor Sixtus Braun is granted an inheritance ship ('Erbschiff') on the Saale and Unstrut in a fief letter ('Lehnsbrief'). There were plans to improve on the navigability of the very shallow Unstrut and Gera, but these were blocked by the electoral prince of Saxony."
"114","The Weiße Elster was deep enough to navigate until the construction of mill runs in the High Middle Ages. It was surely used for rafting."
"116","In 1579-87 a rafting ditch ('Floßgraben') was channeled off at Krossen, in order to transport firewood to the salines in Teuditz and Kötzschau."
"118","An entry in a register of the margraves of Meißen refers to a fee that had to be paid for navigating the Pleiße; there was probably a regular supply transport for the town of Leipzig from the surroundings. The Pleiße was probably navigable from Rötha."
"120","The direct route between Hannover and Braunschweig via Peine probably only became significant after Hannover had become the residence of the dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg (1636). Before, most of the traffic must have taken a detour through Hildesheim territory to the south, or north via Burgdorf."
"122","According to a 1688 report, the road via Dömitz was hard to travel on in wet weather conditions, especially in spring and autumn. Therefore, wagons took the more northerly road via the mill Findenwirunshier, where the toll that normally had to be paid in Dömitz was levied."
"124","The main road between Bremen and Wildeshausen must have gone through Delmenhorst since an agreement between the count of Delmenhorst and the town of Bremen from 1311. Travellers were sometimes stopped in Varrel and forced to travel via Delmenhorst. However, still in 1652, wagoners from Wildeshausen declared that the common road to Bremen went via Horstedt and Varrel."
"126","Due to the marshy terrain, heavier traffic took a detour via Kirch- and Sandhatten. The early modern post road circumvented both villages more to the north."
"128","The original road around the Zwischenahner Meer took the northern route. The more direct but difficult southern route via Zwischenahn is first attested as main road in the 17th century."
"130","Around Apen the road was in a bad condition and often flooded. The traffic between Bremen and East Frisia was therefore often handled via the waterways."
"132","This traveling route has been taken several times by Martin Luther, who traveled from Wittenberg to Borna either via Eilenburg or via Torgau – Grimma. He had to consider territorial borders, in this case the course of the Ernestinian borders around 1485 - 1547."
"134","In 1489 the Fien dam at the narrowest place of the Fien mire ('Fiener Bruch') is repaired, which means that traffic from Magdeburg to Berlin now starts to move via Ziesar."
"136","The course of the road from Erfurt to Weißensee via Stotternheim, Alpenstedt, Haßleben and Wundersleben is described in the ""Acta die Landstraße von Weißensee nach Erfurt und die Sachsenburgische Straße betr. von 1522 - 72"" (M. st. A. Hep. A 24 b Tit. XXIV, Nr 11.) "
"138","In documents concerning the safe conduct of Artern from 1661, it is stated that the road between Artern and Reinsdorf, that consisted of several bridges, dams, ditches and pavements in order to cross the Unstrut, was badly damaged by the 30-year-war."
"140","The road from Schönewerda to Allstedt was moved via Artern after 1580 in consideration of the saline in Artern. A road dam was constructed to directly connect Allstedt and Artern."
"142","This leg of the via regia as a direct connection to Naumburg was only made possible by the construction of a bridge in Kösen in 1393."
"144","This leg of the road only gains meaning from 1560 when it is opened for traffic from the Netherlands via Mühlhausen to Leipzig. It loses significance in the 19th century."
"146","This road already held significance in the Early Middle Ages; Henry I. and his bride used it to travel from Herford to Wallhausen. Later it gained significance with the rising trade centres Leipzig and Antwerp. It's direct connection to the Wipper-Leine valley and thus to Hessia and Western Germany gave this route its importance. Therefore, it carried names such as the ""Leipzig road"", ""the proper country and military road from the Harz, Eichsfeld and Nordhausen to Leipzig and Naumburg"" or ""main Rhine road""."
"148","The route via the valley of the Unstrut was only used rarely, even though only the leg between Memleben and Nebra posed geographical difficulties. Supposedly, the northwest-southeast direction was only seldomly used during the Middle Ages."
"150","Since 1515, this was supposed to be the proper road from Nuremberg to Erfurt. One had a choice from Gehren to go via Langewiesen and Ilmenau or via Gräfinau."
"152","This connection between Nordhausen and Sondershausen probably only emerged in the 17th and 18th century. It can only be found in a map from 1750, where it is referred to as postal and country road, while the leg further West via Rüxleben is referred to as ""common road""."
"154","This road was determined to be the proper road to Nuremberg from Leipzig in 1683."
"156","In 1470 the route from Hof to Schleiz was forbidden for trade to Leipzig and only trade to Erfurt was allowed. Traffic to Leipzig had to travel via Plauen or Oelsnitz. Apparently, this decree had to be enforced several times; in 1551 people are still reminded of the proper road."
"158","In 1433 and 1459 it was decreed that traffic between Brandenburg and Magdeburg had to travel via Plaue, where toll had to be paid. With the reconstruction of the Fien dam, traffic began to move via Ziesar and this leg of the road became deserted."
"160","The road through the valley at the foot of the Harz mountains was probably only used from the 17th century. Before, most of the traffic between Osterode and Herzberg must have taken the route higher up on the hill to the east."
"162","Since 1515 contractually agreed upon compulsory road from Hamburg, Lübeck and Eisleben from the Harz to Thüringen. In a report to Guthmannshausen, the road via Nebra, Tauhardt and Guthmannshausen was referred to as the main road for wares originating from Lübeck, Braunschweig and Magdeburg and going to Franken."
"164","The direct road between Schladen and Wiedelah/Vienenburg is mentioned in 18th-century sources; its importance for earlier centuries is hard to assess."
"166","The Oker river was made navigable between Schladen and Wolfenbüttel in 1575, and between Schladen and Oker in 1577, among others by the construction of locks in the river. This was connected to the reconstruction of the town of Wolfenbüttel into a fortress by the dukes of Brunswick. The river mainly served the transport of stones and timber for construction works in the town. Shipping on the river came to a halt in the Thirty Years' War."
"168","The Nette (Altenau) was made navigable in 1575, mainly for the transport of stones from the Elm, which were needed for the reconstruction of the town Wolfenbüttel into a fortress by the dukes of Braunschweig. According to a source from 1578, the river was navigable up to Schöppenstedt. However, regarding the low depth of the stream, it is questionable whether it was much used, and shipping on the stream must have stopped around 1610."
"170","Although shipping activity in Braunschweig might have taken place in the High Middle Ages, it came to a halt due to staple claims of Lüneburg in the 14th century. Shipping on the Oker and Aller river between Braunschweig and Celle was officially allowed in a treaty from 1459 (with the exception of salt, iron and stockfish), and stimulated by construction works in the following years. Shipping traffic on this river segment flourished for some decades, but must have come to a halt before 1507, when it was noticed that toll revenues from Braunschweig ships in Celle had dropped to zero."
"172","The Leine river was opened for shipping from Hannover in 1381 after the War of the Lüneburg Succession and a feud with the Mandelsloh family, who owned extensive property along the river. Agreements with weir owners secured that ships could pass the obstacles. Shipping on the Leine led to conflicts with Lüneburg and Celle because of its toll and staple claims. An agreement with Hannover for 10 years in 1507 settled the conflict, but it was not renewed afterwards and shipping on the river was discontinued."
"174","This road was named Hooge Weg or Via Alta. From the beginning of the fifteenth century to the end of the sixteenth century, it marked the border ('Markegrens') between Hees and Heese Veld."
"176","With the Ilmenau privilege of 1348, the town Lüneburg received the right to remove obstacles in the Ilmenau river upstream from the town in order to make the river navigable. It was mainly used for the transport of firewood for the Lüneburg saltworks. According to a document from 1393, the dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg had obstructed the river. The section between Medingen and Uelzen was given up in 1562."
"178","The town of Hamburg tried to prevent free shipping on the southern arm of the Elbe river in order to protect its staple market from the late 14th century onwards. With the acquisition of Moorburg on the southern shore of the river in 1375, the town was able to control the shipping on the southern Elbe and forced passing ships to sail to Hamburg, despite a conflict with the dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg and the towns Harburg, Stade and Buxtehude, and a 1619 verdict of the Imperial Chamber Court that shipping on the southern Elbe should be free."
"180","According to a document from 1033, the Ruhr river was navigable until the abbey of Werden. Although shipping is not mentioned in the Ruhr law of 1542, Ruhr barges are mentioned in the harbour regulations of Wesel in 1681. This suggests that at least the lower course of the river remained navigable through the centuries."
"182","In 1390, Lübeck and the duke of Saxony-Lauenburg came to an agreement that gave the town permission to create a waterway between the Stecknitz in Mölln and the Delvenau, which flows into the Elbe near Lauenburg. A stretch of 11km was dug south of Mölln, the Delvenau was canalised and various locks were constructed until 1398. The resulting so-called Stecknitz canal was much used for salt transports between Lüneburg and Lübeck."
"184","Hamburg acquired permission to construct a canal between the Alster in Stegen and the Beste/Trave in Sülfeld in 1448, in order to create a through-going waterway with Lübeck. The project was only realised as late as 1529, and despite the construction of many locks, there were constant problems with keeping enough water in the canal. Shipping on the canal came to a halt ca. 20 years after its opening."
"186","The land routes from Harburg and Winsen to the south, circumventing Lüneburg, were prohibited for commercial traffic under the Lüneburg staple privileges of 1392, and from 1467 also for the drift of cattle. However, the town was not always able to enforce the prohibition to use these routes."
"188","The Ems river between Rheine and Greven became navigable after the construction of a mill weir in Rheine in 1550. Attempts to stimulate shipping on the river upstream from Greven in the 17th century failed due to low water levels."
"190","The Ems river was navigable for larger ships only until Meppen. For smaller barges or during higher water levels, shipping was possibly towards Rheine or Greven."
"192","Around 1480, the dukes of Mecklenburg undertook attempts to create a waterway between the Elbe river and the Baltic Sea via the Schwerin lake using the Stör and Elde rivers, which failed mainly because of resistance of the elector of Brandenburg. Renewed attempts from 1564 onwards resulted in the construction of a new canal between Dömitz and Eldena in 1568-1572, circumventing Brandenburg territory. The waterway was now navigable between Dömitz and the Schwerin lake. The connection between the Schwerin lake and Wismar, however, met with technical difficulties and was probably never operational, despite a depiction of the waterway as a throughgoing canal on a map of Daniel Frese from 1605."
"194","In 1412 and 1430, Lüneburg received privileges to build new waterways through Mecklenburg territory to transport its salt to the Baltic Sea harbours. From 1553 to 1564, the Schaale river was made navigable, among others by building seven locks. This made shipping between the Elbe river near Boizenburg and lake Schaalsee possible. In Dutzow, on the northern shore of the lake, commodities could be transshipped onto the land road towards the harbour towns. Plans to built a canal between the lake and the town of Wismar were never realised."
"196","The count of Delmenhorst and the town of Bremen agreed in 1311 to maintain the street between Bremen and Delmenhorst via Huchting for wagons and pedestrians. Previous routes, more northerly via Seehausen and Hasbergen or southerly via Ganderkesee, were now redirected through Delmenhorst. However, the low-lying new road often suffered from flooding, in which case the old routes were used, and inhabitants of Huchting provided ferry services."
"198","In an agreement between Mainz and Hessia from 1572, this leg of the road from Wanfried to Langensalza is referred to as new road and non-open country road. In 1583 it is elevated to a road of safe conduct."
"200","People started leaving Reimerswaal because of the increasing dangers from floods. In 1631, Reimerswaal was deserted for good and was claimed by the sea."
"202","Shortly before 1600, landgrave Moritz of Hessen-Kassel launched a project to make the Fulda river navigable, among others through the construction of seven locks. The first ship could sail from Kassel to Hersfeld in 1601. However, it is uncertain whether the river was much used as a waterway; shipping must have come to a halt during the Thirty Years' War."
"204","This road was probably already mentioned in 1027 in a border description, in 1227 it appears as ""Weinstraße""."
"206","A record from 1330 refers to this leg of the road as ""Hohe Straße""."
"208","Possibly, this route did not exist in 1600, but developed later."
"210","Developed as a route in the seventeenth century?"
"212","The polder in which Klaaswaal was located came into being in 1539."
"214","The polder between Klaaswaal and Oudesluis was created in 1602."
"216","The polder in which Numansdorp is located, was created in 1642."
"218","Meijel was located on a sand ridge in the otherwise hardly passable Peel high moor region. The existence of a road at this place probably goes back to Roman times, as archaeological evidence attests. In the 18th century, a main road between 's-Hertogenbosch and Cologne is mentioned here, which is supported by the existence of a toll and inns in Meijel. However, the marshy terrain must have made it difficult to use the road. According to English military D. Paterson in 1748, the road was ""impassable in winter for wagons of any size"". It must therefore have had only secondary importance, with most traffic circumventing the Peel region."
"220","The road between Hamm and Lünen on the left shore of the Lippe was very soggy and was probably only used for long-distance traffic after the Thirty Years' War."
"222","Marked as a secondary route before the 15th century in the Mitteldeutscher Heimatatlas."
"224","Before the bridges in Berka/Werra were built, a route along the Werra with a ford in Wartha was ocassionally used. However, the ford was a difficult crossing and afterwards an elevation had to be crested, which was only removed in the 19th century."
"226","With the construction of a large pound lock in the dam in Zaandam, which was finished in 1547, the Zaan river became the main waterway between Amsterdam and the northern quarter of Holland. Before, the dam was only passable for small vessels; larger ships between Alkmaar and Amsterdam took a detour via Edam."
"228","After the Hollandse IJssel was dammed from the Lek river in 1285, the river gradually silted up. In 1486 it was mentioned that the river was not navigable anymore between IJsselstein and Oudewater due to this process."
"230","The tow canal ('trekvaart') between Amsterdam and Haarlem was constructed in 1631-1632. Upon insistence of Haarlem, who collected toll on the Spaarne river, the canal remained limited to passenger traffic only; heavy freight continued to use the old route via the IJ and Spaarne. Because of the existence of three sluices in Halfweg ('midway'), the canal was interrupted and passengers had to change barges there."
"232","The southern route between Lüneburg and Soltau via Amelinghausen was the older one and later became known as the cart road; heavier traffic used the northern road via Soderstorf and Hützel from the late 15th century."
"234","The northern road between Lüneburg and Soltau via Soderstorf and Hützel developed for heavier traffic in the late 15th or 16th century. It was later known as the freight or post road."
"236","According to Bruno Ploetz, the road between Lüneburg and Celle via Tellmer and Oberohe was the old cart road for lighter traffic. Its importance decreased in the 18th century in favour of the freight road for heavier traffic via Müden."
"238","According to Bruno Ploetz, the freight road for heavier traffic between Lüneburg and Celle via Müden developed in the 16th century and gradually replaced the cart road via Tellmer and Oberohe."
"240","The ""Hessenkarrenweg"" (Hessian cart road) was the road for carts between Braunschweig and Lüneburg. A road for heavier freight wagons ran more to the east on some parts of the route."
"242","The freight road for heavy freight wagons between Braunschweig and Lüneburg ran east of the cart road on some parts of the route."
"244","The road between Bienenbüttel to Oldenstadt and Uelzen via Medingen and Jastorf was known as the winter freight road, because it was usable the entire year, in contrast to the more westerly ""summer freight road""."
"246","The road between Bienenbüttel and Uelzen via Seedorf was known as the summer freight road, because it could only be used in dry weather conditions, in contrast to the winter road via Jastorf."
"248","In 1640, the towns of Harlingen, Franeker and Leeuwarden acquired permission to build towpaths along the already existing sailing route between the towns. The first barge ('trekschuit') sailed the route in 1646. There were five barges in both directions daily. Passengers paid 12 penny for each mile; pedestrians on the tow path 8 penny."
"250","A tow canal between Leeuwarden, Bolsward and Workum was constructed in 1648."
"252","The sailing route between Dokkum and Leeuwarden was equipped with a tow path for regular barge ('trekschuit') services in 1647."
"254","The Damsterdiep between Groningen and Delfzijl was equipped with tow paths for regular barge ('trekschuit') services in 1648-1650."
"256","On Jacob van Deventer's map of Sloten (mid-16th century), the road leading Northeast towards Sint Nicolaasga is indicated to be a mere footpath. On maps from the mid-17th century, the current road (Spanjaardsdijk) is drawn."
"258","Shipping on the Oude IJssel does not seem to have taken place before 1582, when the water mill in Keppel, an obstruction to sailing on the river, had been demolished. A document from 1590 attests that at this time, there was traffic between Doesburg and Doetinchem. In 1592, works were undertaken to make the river navigable until Bocholt and Anholt."
"260","After the flood of St Elisabeth (1421), which radically changed the Rhine delta in Holland, the IJssel river gradually became shallower. In the late 16th and 17th century, the river had silted up so much, that the low water levels and numerous sandbanks made sailing impossible during large parts of the year."
"262","The road between Utrecht and Amersfoort was radically reconstructed as a 60m wide, completely straight avenue in 1652: the ""wegh der weegen"" ('road of roads'). There seems to have been a medieval precursor of this road at more or less the same place, but its exact course is unknown."
