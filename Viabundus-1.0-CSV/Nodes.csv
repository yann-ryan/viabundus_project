The staple privilege was confirmed by emperor Rudolf II in 1597. The shipping regulations from 1653 mention the right of Münden skippers to sail past the town, whereas skippers from other towns were obliged to unload their cargo in Münden. Moreover, the Münden skippers sought to acquire a privilege for shipping between Münden and Kassel. The staple led to numerous conflicts, mostly with Kassel, in the 16th and 17th centuries.

Excluded was the toll on the Weser bridge, which was owned by the count of Hoya.
The Akzise, import and export duties, accounted for about 86% for the entire income of the city in 1600. Moreover, from 1426 onwards a buoy toll ('tonnengeld') for maintenance of the traffic signs on the lower Weser river, a tidal area, was levied for each incoming and outgoing ship. Responsible for the levying of the latter toll were the eldermen of the common merchant.

The town laws of the ""Kundige Rolle"" (1450, 1498) contain a three-day staple obligation for commodities coming from the sea and wood coming down the Weser, as well as a prohibition of the trade between non-citizens.
Complaints from Minden on the Hanseatic Diets in 1506, 1507 and 1511 show that the staple could not be fully enforced. In 1541, the emperor confirmed the staple obligations, but revoked the charter in the same year. Minden citizens were exempted from the Bremen staple in 1552, but from 1611 there were renewed attempts to enforce the staple towards Minden merchants. The ""Weddeordnung"" of 1612 prohibited merchants from neighbouring towns to transport herring, butter, fish, tar, fish oil, tallow, corn, wine, beer and other commodities through Bremen. The staple was abolished with the ""Weserschifffahrtsakte"" of 1823.","y","965","","The fairs in Bremen went back at least to the market privileges of 965, probably even into the 9th century.

Tolls were mainly levied on wine, so a tariff of 2 shillings per barrel applied in 1290. For more information on tariffs and revenues, see source. This toll was probably established as the successor to the Orsoy toll. From 1352, Duisburg customs were also levied in Büderich. From about 1438 onwards, customs tariffs were differentiated according to whether the goods took the Rhine or the Waal route. 2) During the Soest feud (1444-1450), a fee for save conduct on the river was also levied. This is documented in 1445, but was not continued thereafter. 3) In 1417/1446, a land toll was levied. Tariffs are not known.

From 1441, there are clear attempts to force merchants to offer their commodities on the market, and in 1451 and 1482, Polish and Lithuanian merchants complained about the prohibition of trading between non-citizens. After Danzig was confiscated by Poland (1454), King Casimir confirmed the prohibition to travel between the sea and the hinterland without a stop in Danzig. In 1584, the staple for English cloth was moved to Elbing; in 1628, Danzig regained the exclusive import rights on foreign cloth.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hanseatic staple for Rhenish wines in 1452, together with Antwerp. Staple for wine and salt for Holland and Friesland in 1453. In the 16th century, there were growing conflicts with other cities about the staple, which led to Middelburg being freed from staple obligations in Dordrecht in 1533. The staple was still confirmed by the emperor in 1540, but restricted in the following year: only corn, legumes, salt, wine, lime, coal, millstones and iron transported on Lek, Merwede and Maas had to be brought to Dordrecht.

The 1379 edict about the freedom of shipping on the Oder limited the possibilities to enforce the staple, but it was still mentioned in the town privileges from 1473. A treaty with Breslau from 1490 limited the crossing of the Oder by merchants to Breslau and Frankfurt, but proved difficult to enforce because of Polish counter-measures. In 1507, merchants from Poland, Russia, Lithuania, Masovia and Prussia were prohibited to trade further than Frankfurt and Breslau. The staple privileges were confirmed in 1510 and 1512, but could not be reinforced in the wake of the collapse of the staple of Breslau in 1515. However, both staples were reinstated in 1530 and confirmed in 1555, 1624 and 1643. The street via Landsberg was not allowed to be used by transit traffic. The prohibition of shipping on the Oder South of Frankfurt from 1459 was cancelled in 1555 for salt transports; all other commodities had to be transported on the land route. When the Spree was made navigable by the construction of a lock in Fürstenwald in 1588, Frankfurt constructed a storage house there for transshipment to the Frankfurt staple. The staple was abolished in 1752, having been reduced to a monopoly on the linseed trade.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A corn staple was introduced in 1343, whereby half of the corn from the region around the city had to be stored within the town. Conflicts with Ypres because of the corn staple were solved in favour of Ghent in 1424, and it was further enforced in 1484. Further fixation of the grain stapel in 1484: a quarter of the corn shipped through the city and all corn grown in Flanders had to be offered to the local population for 8-14 days. In 1486 and 1514, the staple was reiterated. The forced offering of commodities for sale was abolished in 1540, but in in its place came a forced transshipment between Scheldt and Leie, and in 1547 for the Sassevaart.

In 1599, all foreign commodities except horses and cattle were exempted from staple obligations. For domestic commodities, the staple obligations existed mainly for corn, butter and cheese.

The new town (Neustadt) was founded by Duke Adolf III of Schauenburg and received Lübeck town privileges in 1188. Both parts were united around 1215.","y","1188","","Four tolls existed in Hamburg:
1) the Count, Priest or Schaumburg toll of the territorial lords was first mentioned in 1188 and in 1460 half went to the Danish royal house and from 1640 in its entirety. The levying of the toll was, however, in the hands of the town, to whom it was regularly pawned. Payment of the toll was handled at the town gates and at the harbour entrance; merchants from Bremen, Brandenburg, Meißen, Magdeburg, Braunschweig and Saxony were exempted.
2) The Werkzoll, first mentioned in 1309, was raised by the council of Hamburg to finance navigation beacons for the isle of Neuwerk and the Lower Elbe; it was privileged by the Emperor in 1628.
3) A toll for securing the sea lanes from pirates and robbers was raised as a pound toll first in 1362, then from 1424 with some breaks until 1528. From 1541 the toll was raised in cooperation with Lübeck; in 1552 the toll was imposed unilaterally by Hamburg and converted into a grain toll after complaints from Lübeck in 1557. After the foundation of the Admiralty in 1623 a new toll for the defence of the sea lanes was raised.
4) The Land and Elbe toll for trade heading inland by both water and land; toll records are edited by Pitz. Registers from the Land and Elbe toll and the Admiralty toll have survived from the 17th century; they were partly assessed by Reißmann. Pound toll records from 1485-6 have also been edited. ","y","1458","1748","3.0","First attempts to establish a staple can be seen in the toll tariffs of 1236, where it is recorded that merchants were exempted from toll payment when they offered their commodities for sale on the market in Hamburg. In the following centuries, ever more trade limitations were taken; the town law of 1458 first contained an obligation for merchants to offer butter, cheese, fish and corn for sale on the local market for three days. The staple was confirmed by king Christian I of Denmark in 1480 and by the emperor in 1482. Merchants from Brandenburg were exempted from the staple between 1518 and 1555, but had to sell 2/3 of their grain in Hamburg afterwards. A threat for the staple was posed by the possible circumvention of town via the southern Elbe arm, which Hamburg tried to prevent from the 14th century. This led to conflicts with Brunswick-Lüneburg, Stade and Buxtehude in the 16th and 17th centuries. Despite a verdict of the imperial chamber court from 1619 that traffic on the southern Elbe should be free, the emperor confimed the staple privileges in 1621, and in 1628 Hamburg's control over the southern Elbe as well. After the mid-17th century, the staple was ever more difficult to enforce and finally abolished in 1748.","y","1000","","","","","","","","","","","y","","","Until the cosntruction of a new crane on the inner harbour in the 16th century, the only crane was that on the square adjacent to the town hall.

In 1460, the old fairs were replace by two six-day fairs, for a trial period of four years: the fair of St Michael remained, and a new fair took place on Misericordia Sunday. Apparently the trial was a success, because in 1476, the two fairs were reiterated for the period of 12 years with slight modifications. After that period and before 1523, the situation must have changed again, since it is mentioned in the latter year that there were four three-day fairs in the town, which had been held since times of old: next to the fairs of St Michael and Misericordia Sunday, the Annunciation fair had been revived and a new fair on Wednesday after Pentecost was added.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These settlements, however, never developed an urban character. The granting of town rights was part of an administrative reorganization in which a number of smaller settlements were granted town rights in order to provide them with a certain degree of self-government which replaced the need for the count of Holland's bailiffs ('baljuws'). The settlements kept their own separate settlement governments.

    This was a toll for sailing transport on river Rhine and a continuation of the toll of Angeren. In 1656 the levying of the toll moved to Emmerich.
    In 1751 a new ""Lizent zu Huissen"" was founded for the sailing traffic that came from Nijmegen via river Waal to Arnhem. This ended in 1816 as the Huissen and Malburgen area were incorporated into the Netherlands.

Citizens of Krempe were exempted from staple obligations for salt, corn and timber in 1271, but the enforcement of the staple often led to conflicts between both towns in the following centuries. The staple privileges were confirmed against Krempe interests in 1496, but Krempe was exempted from the staple for beer and timber transports in 1540. Further exemptions were introduced in 1575 for the noble Rantzau family, in 1607 and 1609 for timber and cheese transported from and to Wilster, and in 1627 for timber from Glückstadt. In 1638, a prohibition for foreigners to trade with each other was introduced.","y","1350","","It is not known how old the fairs in Itzehoe are.

The latter was one of the most important markets for oxen driven from Jutland, which was held on the premises of the monastery. The oxen fair on St Gallus and the horse fair on Bürgertag were extended to 8 days in 1655. In 1489, five fairs were added: 3 weeks before Carnival, 8 days before Carnival, Sunday before Reminiscere, Thursday before Palm Sunday, and 8 days before St James, the latter being also the day the regional court took place in Itzehoe. A second horse fair in the early modern period took place 3 days before Sunday Letare.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Only special tariffs are known. In 1396, for example, the people of Venlo had to pay 3 old groschen per piece of wine. The annual revenue of the Geldern toll in 1294/95 was 25 Cologne mark. 2) The Duke of Guelders also levied a fee for safe conduct on land in Kessel.

From the 16th century onwards, it usually took place in the week after Epiphany. In some years, it was also held in other towns such as Rendsburg and Oldesloe. The Umschlag was discontinued in 1911, but revived as a funfair in 1975.

This was levied from 1000/1018 to 1302, 1309 to 1343 and from 1350 to 1362. A tarif roll from 1140 exists. The Archbishop of Trier held the toll from 1018 to 1042. From 1042 to about 1300, the monastery of St. Simeon in Trier held it. From about 1250 to 1267 and from 1300 onwards, the property went back to the Archbishop of Trier. In 1309 and 1314, 6 Turnosgroschen had to be paid for each foder of wine. From 1317 to 1321, 12 Turnosgroschen had to be paid per foder of wine, in 1345 15 Turnosgroschen and in 1358 already 17 Turnosgroschen. In 1267, 500 to 800 marks could be collected. From 1345 to 1348 the toll was leased for 655 pounds turnosgroschen (equivalent to 13100 guilders) a year. 2) The Archbishop of Trier collected a fee for safe conduct on the Rhine from 1250 to 1267. The annual revenue in 1267 was about 40 mark. 3) Parallel to the Rhine toll, there was a river toll on the Moselle, which was paid together with the river toll on the Rhine until about 1336. The owner and early tariffs are therefore identical. In 1354, 12 Turnosgroschen had to be paid per foder of wine, in 1430 1 Gulden per foder of wine. In 1336/37 and 1338/39 the annual rent was 40 pounds turnosgroschen. In 1344/46 59 pounds Turnosgroschen and in 1358/61 120 pounds Turnosgroschen could be collected. 4) In addition to the two river tolls, a land toll was also levied. Before 1000, 4 denarii per pack animal had to be paid. Annual revenues are not known. 5) The Archbishop of Trier levied bridge fee here from 1359, although the Moselle bridge was not completed until 1363. This suggests that it was already usable in 1359.

In the period between 1317 and 1321, 6 Turnosgroschen per foder of wine had to be paid. From 1475 to 1494 the tariff was 2 guilders and 2 turnosgroschen per barrel of wine. In the years 1317 to 1320, 1400 pounds 14 shillings and 5 turnosgroschen could be collected. This corresponds to about 9338 guilders a year. For other annual revenues, see Pfeiffer. 2) In 1103 a gate toll was also levied. Around 1360 1/3 of the revenue went to the town and 2/3 to the Archbishop of Cologne. In the 12th century only special tariffs are known. In 1453, 3 heller had to be paid for a loaded carriage across the Rhine. At the end of the 14th century, 4 heller had to be paid per wine carriage.

In late 1300s renewed attempts for the imposition of a staple; wood must remain in the town for one day; the Fishmonger ordinances of 1397 forced foreigners to seller their fish to the merchants of Cologne; ordinances of 1407 stipulated that wine, wood, fish, salt and iron should be offered for sale in the city; regulations regarding these matters became stricter throughout the 15th century. The Ordinances of the Merchant Store and the Old Market of 1486 contained new regulations for the staples for meat, oils and fats, iron, steel, lead and leather. Attempts at end of the 15th century to enforce staple rights in the trade of cattle, cloth and wool. The unloading of goods while travelling along the lower Rhine banned in 1497, but not mentioned in the imperial staple privileges for 1505. The staple after 1505 appears to decline, but is re-enforced in 1525/6. The bypassing of the staple via Neuss, Bonn and Mülheim encouraged the council in 1603 to forbid the unloading of goods along the Rhine in both directions. From 1616 there were exemptions for stone from Andernach. Staple confirmed once again by the emperor in 1635; after the Thirty Years’ War the staple was gradually transformed into a requirment to transfer wares and was finally dissolved with the Rhine Shipping act of 1831.

Moreover, tolls were levied on the cargo of ships leaving the town, as well as for wagons, carts, cattle, pigs and sheep entering town at the town gates. Special regulations were made for Slavic people. In lists of town incomes from the 15th century, a ""graventol"" at the Holstentor and Mühlentor gates is mentioned as well, which was levied on the shipping on the Stecknitz canal (""graven""). Moreover, between 1492 and 1496, a ""pound toll"" for the suppression of piracy was levied on sea-going ships, of which extensive registers still exist.","y","1417","1728","3.0","The Hanserecesse of 1417 and 1418 forbade the transport of grain through the Danish straits and outside of the Hanseatic towns, which guided much trade to Lübeck (HR I, 6 n 397, § 60 n 398 und 557). The banning of foreigners trading with eachother is first attested in 1472 (HUB 10:76). Hollanders were obliged to offer bacon, butter and oil from Scandinavia and wine for 4-7 days; the Peace of Utrecht (1474) confirmed these practices, but reduced the length of time to days on account of the perishable nature of the wares, with stockfish, herring, cod and seal blubber excepted. In the 16th century the east-west trade through the Sound increased, bypassing Lübeck. Negotiations with the Hollanders regarding this ended in 1532 to Lübeck’s disadvantage. The forced sale and storage of wine, fish and others wares was cause for conflict with Denmark and Hamburg, and the ordinance of 1607 modified the staple: trade with guests was forbidden, wares of Danish merchants were forbidden (except for wine), and the same for copper, iron, pelts, oil, tar and other wares from Sweden and Finland excepting wares from Russia (including leather, tallow, wax and flax, among others). After a legal decision arising from a dispute with Hamburg in 1625, Lübeck largely relaxed the compulsory sale of staple goods in the city. Renewed attempts at imposing the staple in the 18th century led once again to conflict, until the council implicitly let it fall into abeyance after 1728.

In the 16th ships on the Elbe were increasingly forced to unload their goods in Bleckede and carry them to market in Lüneburg, which led to a conflict with Hamburg and Magdeburg, and in 1574 the stopping of the traffic on the Elbe was limited to ships carrying boy salt (from the Bay of Biscay) upstream.

In the 16th century, the staple right was threatened by Leipzig, since Magdeburg lay in its zone of influence. This led to a contract with Hamburg concerning the protection of the staple rights of both towns in 1538. During the imperial ban 1547-1567 the staple in Magdeburg was revoked, but later re-established as a three-day depot right and mandatory turnover. In 1571 this is changed into a depot fee. Starting from 1596 it was handled as a depot and turnover right again. The destruction of the town during the 30-year war (1631) meant an end to the staple, but soon thereafter there were several attempts to re-establish it.

Nuremberg needed to carry their goods to Miltenburg by land and there load them into ships. As the Nurembergers sometimes shipped their wares to Bamberg and Würzburg under fake marks, an agreement was reached between the Archbishop of Mainz and the city of Nuremberg, and in 1521 ships from Bamberg were held and unloaded in Miltenberg. In 1539 the staple was disestablished in return for Nuremberg credit, but was installed again in 1547. Emperor Charles V stipulated in a law of 1555 that the staple should be disestablished. In 1562 the agreement reached stipulated that Nurembergs could enjoy free shipping rights in return for a yearly payment of 200 golden gulden. The Nurembergers were only to load their goods in Bamberg, but from 1685 they could also do the same in Kitzingen and Würzburg. An ordinance of 1818 ended the market and exchange rights for Miltenberg. ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Bremen, complaints that shipments of corn were being withheld in Minden are known from 1532, which led to a centuries-long conflict between both towns. The staple privileges were confirmed by the emperor in 1627, although it was enforced relatively mildly in the 17th century.

Next to the fair of St Martin, a new fair was held on St Walburga. These fairs still exist today as the Autumn and May fairs.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the vicinity, a trading settlement developed that became the old town of Neuss. In Carolingian times, a castle is mentioned here.","y","1200","","Neuss is first characterised as ""oppidum"" in 1170 and probably became a full town around 1200. The oldest town seal dates from 1245. Various privileges were granted in the next centuries. Among others, Neuss was granted the privileges of a Hanse town in 1475 by emperor Frederick III.","y","877","","1) Already in 877, an Imperial toll for ships hauled upstream on the Rhine existed in Neuss. Pfeiffer claims that this toll was market-related. A Rhine toll of the bishop of Cologne is mentioned in 1138. The towns of Cologne and temporarily Rees were exempted from the toll. The Rhine toll was moved to Zons because of changes in the course of the river in 1372. In 1243, at least 6 denarii per ship had to be paid. In 1236 about 1200 Cologne mark were collected, in 1256 about 800 Cologne mark. For further tariffs and revenues, see Pfeiffer.
2) A market toll is mentioned in 1138 and 1169, and in 1203 a transit toll for land traffic of the bishop of Cologne. At least between 1389 and 1393, a horse toll was levied by the bishop, and a toll for safe conduct was granted by king Wenceslaus in 1396. In 1396, 2 to 3 alb. per horse had to be paid, depending on the load. In the years 1389/93, an average of about 2152 mark per year could be collected. Half of the land toll was acquired by the town of Neuss in 1455; in 1463 completely. In 1455, about 700 Rhenish guilders were collected. Elaborate details about the practice of levying the toll are known from testimonies written during a 1478-1479 conflict about the toll between Düsseldorf and Neuss. To prevent circumventing of the toll station, the toll was levied at many secondary toll stations around town as well. Detailed list of toll tariffs are known from 1601 and 1618.
3) The town of Neuss also levied a road toll in 1373. However, the Archbishop of Cologne declared this to be illegitimate, which is why its existence after 1373 is not known.","","","","","","y","1300","","It is unknown when the fairs in Neuss originated. In the 14th century, there were three fairs, on St Walpurga, St John and St Remigius. A fourth one on St Bartholomew was added before 1419. The four fairs were confirmed by emperor Frederick III in 1475, who also granted a fifth fair on St Martin. All fairs were to last four days before and after the said dates. The St Walpurga fair, which coincided with the feast on the dedication day of the church of St Quirinus, attracted most visitors, together with St John's fair in the 15th and 16th centuries.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

No other tolls will be levied between Hannover and Rethem. A 1507 agreement between Hannover and Celle regulated the fares for toll and safe conduct in Essel. Toll receipts for the journey from and to Hannover were copied into a register of the town Hannover for the years 1507-1515. Likely, these refer to the the toll levied in Neustadt, as Essel is not located on the Leine.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","y","","","","","","",""

1) The market toll of the bishop, granted in 1028, was a tax on bought and sold commodities in town. Before 1301, the toll was acquired by the noble Schilder family, in the service of the bishop, and the toll became known as the Schilderzoll. It was probably levied in the Schildern alley, which might have been named after the family and the toll. In the 15th century, the toll was sold to Paderborn citizens and in 1491 to the town. Afterwards it was turned into a road toll.
2) The ""small toll"" belonged to the family Endehachte, who sold it to the cathedral treasurer in 1311. Further details are not known.
3) A fee for safe conduct, called ""gheleyde"", owned by the lords of Lippe at the beginning of the 14th century. It was sold to bishop Heinrich III in 1367. According to a 16th-century document, this toll was levied on commodities bought by foreigners in Paderborn territory and transported through town. Inhabitants of the territory were exempted from the toll. Some registers of this toll exist from the 16th century.","","","","","","y","1028","","Paderborn acquired market privileges in 1028. The oldest fair was that of St Gallus, which is mentioned in 1327 as taking place in front of the western town gate according to old custom. It was mainly used for agricultural products. A second fair of St John appears in the early 16th century; it was replaced by bishop Erich in 1521 with two new fairs, on the Chair of St Peter and on Mary Magdalene. Both fairs had three free market days before and after the fair day.

Expansion of staple privileges in 1312: ban on the export of grain between Stettin and Ückermunde and on timber and coal between Stettin, Ziegenort, Crampe, and Altdamm, with imports into Stettin excepted. Around the middle of the 15th century a dispute between Stettin and Stargard over the bypassing of the Stettin stapel by shipping on the river on Ihna was settled in favour of Stettin. Confirmation of the staple followed in 1467, including the stipulation that all wares on ships coming from the sea into the Stettin lagoon and wares entering Stettin overland from the Oder basin should be stapled in Stettin.

When the staple lost importance after the peace of Thorn in 1411, it was reinstated in 1428 and now included corn; confirmed in 1448 with the inclusion of river transport, and again by King Casimir in 1457 after Toruń became Polish. The staple was cancelled after 1466, with the exception of the obligation to travel only on roads leading through town. Attempts to reinstate the staple led to many conflicts with other cities, until all obligations were annulled in 1496. There were renewed attempts to establish a staple in the 16th century, which was confirmed by the Pope in 1516. The King decided in 1533 that ships on the Vistula heading upstream had to unload in Toruń, although the full staple was not acknowledged. A renewed obligation to travel via Toruń from Danzig to Poland was instated, but cancelled in 1537 again, with the exemption of fish. In the 17th century, only the fish staple still existed.

The Count of Guelders and later the Lord of Millen (before 1328/39) were holders of the toll. In 1339 the toll fell to the Duke of Guelders. In the 14th century, Blerick and Kessel were additional toll stations for the fee for safe conduct. In 1284, 20 mark were collected as fee. In 1295, the toll and the escort fee were leased for 150 old Brabant mark. For more detailed rates and revenues, see Pfeiffer.
2) Around 1271, a land toll was also levied. The Count of Jülich leased the toll to the knight Wilhelm von Broekhuisen. Tariffs are not known. The annual revenue amounted to less than 80 mark. The toll was later no longer mentioned, so that the transit through Venlo was free.

From circa 900 onwards, Zutphen was walled and functioned as a central place for a duke or lord. Oldest mention as 'oppidum' Zutphen dates from 1059. Between 1120 and 1138, the county of Zutphen was inherited by the count of Guelders. ","y","1191","","Town privileges granted between 15 April 1191 and 30 March 1196, by Otto I, count of Guelders and Zutphen. In the thirteenth century, the first stone town wall was finished. From 1339 onwards, Guelders became a duchy. From the fourteenth century onwards, four administrative units (quarters) were distinguished in Guelders; Zutphen functioned as the capital in the Quarter of Zutphen ('Kwartier van Zutphen'). Het Stuvennest or Stuvenest, in the Melatensteeg, was one of the inns in town. It is being named between 1468 and 1531. Already before 1268, a hospital was located just outside the Spitaalpoort along the road towards Emmerich. The course of the river IJssel near Zutphen was influenced by human activity several times. In 1357, the river was changed by cutting the southern meander. Unintentionally, this activated the old IJssel at Empe again. As a result, the town risked to lose its location close to the main stem. In 1406/1407, the meander directly west of the town was being canalized until the Polbeek estuary. As a result, the branch at Empe and the northern meander across the Mars were cut off. The canalized river was located between short banks. From the fifteenth century onwards, the navigability of the river IJssel was being threatened by silting. ","y","1300","","A land road toll ('weggeld') was levied at three town gates. At the Laarpoort (road towards the east: towards Lochem, Twente and Westphalia), the Spittaalpoort or Hospitaalpoort (road towards the south: towards Doetinchem, Emmerich and Cleves), and the Nieuwstadspoort (road towards Deventer). The gates Olypoort and Veerpoort had become redundant after the course of the river IJssel had been altered in the fourteenth century. Sources from the fourteenth century show that the Laarpoort brought in more than the other gates combined. ","","","","","","y","","","Zutphen had one fair at least from 1294/1295 onwards. Fair trading in Zutphen decreased from the beginning of the fifteenth century onwards, despite an ongoing increase in the number of fairs. The Saint Walpurgis fair (1st of May) was the only fair in Guelders with a limited supraregional function. Competition of Zutphen with the town of Deventer was constant.

    The first toll for sailing transport is the Great Guelders toll of Arnhem. It is the continuation of the Lobith toll after this toll was deprived for the Guelders duke and became Clevish in 1473. In or after 1492 the Duke of Guelders founded a new toll station in Arnhem. In combination with the tolls of Nijmegen, Tiel, Zaltbommel, IJsseloord and Zutphen and the tolls on river Meuse, these were the Great Guelders tolls. Toll administration 1543 - 1567, 1574-75, 1586-1604, 1617/18, 1623/24, 1626/28,1636/40, 1655/63, 1663/79, 1688/90 and 1739/41 is preserved in Gelders Archief, 0012 Gelderse Rekenkamer. Toll administration 1801- 1810 is preserved in: Gelders Archief, 0016 Gewestelijke besturen in de Bataafs-Franse tijd.
    The second toll for sailing transport is the Anholt toll, ""Anholtse tol"". It was situated in Arnhem from 1618. This toll was the result of the temporarily removal of the toll of the Duchy of Guelders from Lobith to IJsseloord in the war time between 1372 -1379. 1384 the Duke of Guelders recieved permission from the Holy roman emperor to levy this toll in addition to the one of Lobith permanently. The toll moved temporarily for a short while to Huissen. In 1434 Duke Arnold gave the toll over in pledge (and in 1472 in property) to his brother Willem van Egmond, reason that the name was during many years Arnoldian or Egmondian toll. From 1561 the toll was owned by the Lord of Anholt, so it became the name Anholt toll. In 1816 the toll was transferred to the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Because the toll house at IJsseloord was permanently threatened by the river, from 1618 the levying of the toll took place from the tower above the guardhouse near the Sabelspoort bridge in the town of Arnhem. Toll administration (registers from 1688 - 1756) is preserved in Fürstlich Salm-Salmsche Archiv (FSSA), Schloss Anholt, Anholt, Germany, In: Archiv Arnheimer Zoll: III Zollrechnungen und Zollbücher, Tolregisters van de ontvangers van de Arnheimer Zoll, inv.nrs. 31, 36-40, 43-59.
    The Market toll, 'Merckttol'', this toll for sailing transport was founded before 1249, the year is was levied for the Hospital of St. John. In 1782 is noted that the market toll was levied three times a year for a period of 21 days. the fist time from 11/12 March, the second time the 7th September and the third time the 10th November. The toll was collected then in combination with the Anholt toll.

The origin of this toll is not quite clear. Probably, it is the continuation of tolls near the Medieval ferriage or ferry of Lexkes where toll was levied for the Wageningen market tolls. About 1450 and about 1500 these tolls are documented in two 'Tolboucxkens' in which the tarifs of a lot of Rhine tolls are noted. The first period the toll was levied from 14 days before until 14 days after St Johns day, Midsummer. The second period the toll was levied from 10 days before St Jacobs day until 10 days after. In 1538 a part of the income of this tolls was donated by Duke Willem van Gulik to the town of Wageningen. In 1782 only the second period is still mentioned. Toll registers of this toll are saved in Gelders Archief, 0012 Gelderse Rekenkamer for the years 1739-1774, 1790, 1793 and 0016 Gewestelijke besturen in de Bataafs-Franse tijd for the years 1794 - 1797.","","","","","","","","","","y","1426","","A ferry across the Rijn is first mentioned in 1426.","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dorestad was first mentioned on paper in 695 and dissappeared from the map in the ninth century (after 843). In 948 a 'villa' is indicated as having been known as 'Dorestad' but now being called 'Wijk'.","y","1300","","Wijk bij Duurstede was granted town privileges on 12 March 1300 by Gijsbrecht II, lord of Abcoude and Wijk.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the 17th century, Zaandam became divided in Oost-Zaandam and West-Zaandam, which were merged into a single village Zaandam only in 1811.

Probably, these were passable for smaller vessels. From 1544 to 1547, one of them was replaced with a pound lock from stone, which allowed larger vessels to pass, which made the Zaan the main waterway from Amsterdam to northern Holland. However, the lock was bridged and built over, so that its capacity remained limited. The fee for use of this large lock was 10 stuiver; the town of Alkmaar enjoyed the right of free passage. The second ""Wormer Sluis"" or ""Kleine sluis"" was renewed in 1549, and protests from various villages in 1588 after it was announced that the lock would be closed show that there was a high demand for two passages for ships in the dam. In 1608, an ""overtoom"" (a construction for dragging ships across a barrier) was constructed to allow sea-going ships built at the Zaan shipyards to enter the IJ. A third sluice was built in 1612 in connection with the draining of the Schermer and Beemster lakes."

It is the successor to a royal toll that was dependant of the former Dorestad toll. Originally the Geervliet tol was situated in Geervliet near the Bernisse river. It controlled the trafic coming from the North Sea towards the Netherlands going to Flanders, Brabant and Dordrecht via the rivers Meuse and Scheldt, moreover it controlled the traffic from the rivers Meuse, Waal and Rhine to Dordrecht, Flanders, Brabant and the North Sea. Because skippers tried to avoid the toll, outposts were situated in Sloecketers, Niervaert (Klundert), den Broeck, Hannekijnswairt, Rillant, Borsselshaec, Texel and Vlieland, and Enkhuizen. In the 16th century the toll was relocated to Dordrecht (the office was in the Joppens or Toll tower) because the Bernisse silted. Outposts werd situated then in Geervliet, on the Spui river near Hekelingen, and in Delfshaven, Schiedam, Geertruidenberg, Steenbergen, 's-Grevelduin-Kapelle, Leur, Strijen, Gastel, Oudenbosch, Rosendaal, Brielle, Maassluis, Zwartewaal, Goeree and Breda. The toll was founded and owned by (a predecessor of) the Count of Holland and after the Rebellion against Spain it was owned by the States of Holland and West-Friesland. Registers from the Geervliet toll are preserved for the years 1454, 1500, 1506, 1511, 1516, 1531-34, 1553, 1724 and 1769, 1780-1805 (complete toll), 1389 (branch Strienemonde, fragment),1771- 1795 (branch Rotterdam), 1729 – 1761 (branch Maassluis), 1621 (branch Pietershoek/land van Bonaventure), 1544-46 (for grain transports) ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Together, these settlements formed the ‘stede’ Barsingerhorn. These settlements, however, never developed an urban character. The granting of town rights was part of an administrative reorganization in which a number of smaller settlements were granted town rights in order to provide them with a certain degree of self-government which replaced the need for the count of Holland's bailiffs ('baljuws'). The settlements kept their own separate settlement governments. Many of the town privileges granted in the West-Friesland area (in which Haringhuizen and Barsingerhorn are situated) were withdrawn in 1426. New town privileges were granted to Barsingerhorn in 1427. However, as the lord granted these rights did not have the authority to do so, the privileges were again withdrawn in 1436.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
